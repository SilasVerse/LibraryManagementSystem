# 📚 Library Management System (COBOL)

This was our **OJT (On-the-Job Training) group project**, built completely in **COBOL** — yeah, that legendary ancient programming language! 😅  
It was actually the **first time** we ever learned and coded something in a legacy language like COBOL.  
We had a lot of fun (and pain 😆) figuring things out line by line.

## 🕰️ Why I Uploaded This
Just uploading this project back here **as a memory** — a reminder of where we started and how far we’ve come.  
It’s our small piece of COBOL history 🖥️📖
*“Everyone once started with a messy little project — this was ours.”*😄

## 💡 What the Project Does
It’s a simple **Library Management System** with features like:
- Managing members and books  
- Borrowing and returning books  
- Checking history logs  
- Calculating fines for late returns  

Everything is file-based — no database, just CSVs managed by COBOL programs.  
Even though it’s simple, it really helped us understand how record-level data processing works.

## 👥 Our Team
We were a group of **five members**:
- Htay Lwin (me)
- Khant Ko  
- Kaung Khant Nyein  
- Ei Ei Thant  
- Ei Khine Moe  

We worked together to design and code everything from scratch — CSV handling, validation, and all.

## 🏆 Fun Fact
We actually **won 1st prize** among all the OJT projects of our batch 🎉  
That made all those debugging nights totally worth it!
